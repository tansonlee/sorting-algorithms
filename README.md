## Methodology

First, each algorithm was implemented in Python.
I then created a program which would collect data on these alrogithms.
The perf_counter() function from the time module was used to record the length of time it took for an algorithm to run depending on the size of input.
Each algorithm was run 3 times on each size of input and the average was taken to improve accuracy.
The matplotlib package was used to plot and visualize the data.
